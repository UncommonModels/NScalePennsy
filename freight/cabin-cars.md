title: Cabin Cars

I'll start this section with a bit of a disclaimer: there are a LOT of PRR cabin cars (cabooses) on the market in N-Scale. Most of the ones I have seen are (very) wrong. Here's a list of all the ones I feel are at least decent representations of the prototype.

These are my personal favorite style of cabin car used on the PRR. I'm not sure if it's the iconic Lionel models that inspired my love of the porthole windows or something else, but these certainly were the first models I searched for in N scale.
