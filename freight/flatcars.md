# F30

## Micro-Trains

| Model Number | Car Numbers         | Paint Scheme         |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 045 00 140   | 470128, 470130, 470165, 470182 | No Keystone      |

These should have a vertical brake wheel but instead have a side-mounted one.

# F35

## Micro-Trains

| Model Number | Car Numbers         | Paint Scheme         |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 109 00 010   | 470011, 470016, 470017 | No Keystone      |
| 109 00 011   | 470019              | No Keystone      |

These look very accurate to the prototype from what I can tell, and there are no particular discrepancies of note.
