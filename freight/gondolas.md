# G24

## Brooklyn Locomotive Works

| Model Number | Car Numbers | Paint Scheme |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| BLW-1167     | 351476, 351525, 351638 | Circle Keystone |

These represent the wood versions of the prototype well and seem to have been manufactured by Intermountain. The color is a bit more brown than red (akin to later schemes).

# G26

## Micro-Trains

| Model Number | Car Numbers | Paint Scheme |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| 107 00 090   | 439048 | Circle Keystone |
| 107 00 091   | 439752 | Circle Keystone |

Only three of the braces in the center portion of the model should extend all the way to the bottom but other than that, this is fairly accurate. The paint is a bit more brown than red (more akin to later schemes).

# G28

## Micro-Trains

| Model Number | Car Numbers         | Paint Scheme         |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 046 00 070   | 342610, 342615, 342617, 342652 | Circle Keystone |

These look to be fairly accurate reproductions of the G28, though it looks like the brake wheel is on the side instead of the end and the cars ride significantly higher than the prototype (ah the joys of compromise for practicality when modeling N scale). Older production runs may be a bit more brown and less freight car red.
