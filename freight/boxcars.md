## Micro-Trains

| Model Number | Car Numbers        | Paint Scheme       |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 028 00 130   | 564274, 564279     | Circle Keystone    |
| 028 00 131   | 564275             | Circle Keystone    |

As far as I can tell, the brake wheels on the Micro-Trains offerings should probably be on top and lettering may or may not be consistent with the prototype. Otherwise, pretty close!

| Model Number | Car Numbers      | Paint Scheme         |

| 120 00 260   | 2145             | Circle Keystone, REA |

| 120 00 262   | 2148             | Circle Keystone, REA |
| 020 00 066   | 30902            | Early Merchandise Service |

From my research, the brake wheels on the Micro-Trains offerings should probably be on top for earlier X-29s, but should be fine for an X29b or X29c.

| Various      | Various          | Circle Keystone, REA |

These seem to be made by Kadee/Micro-Trains and look similar, perhaps they were an earlier tooling?

| Various?     | Various?         | Circle Keystone, Buy War Bonds |

These have a molded-on door, but are the most accurate of the bunch. They include vertical brake wheels for separate application.

| 079 00 010   | 48302, 48323, 48334 | Circle Keystone      |


These particular models claim to be the X32b.

| 031 51 480   | 118503 | Friendship Train      |

This claims to be an X41b and sports a special early Merchandise Service "Friendship Train" livery, as part of the 1947 Friendship Train that sent upwards of 250 railcars of dontated food and clothes to France and Italy following WWII.

| 19457        | 118747 | Early Merchandise Service |

This model also claims to be an X41b, with a standard early Merchandise service scheme. it seems quite accurate, but the paint may be a bit off. The silver stripe is extremely shiny and the base color is more brown than freight car red.

## Atlas

|--------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 3433         | 47019            | Early Merchandise Service |

This is mostly accurate to my eye, but the paint scheme is wrong; a later Merchandise Service scheme should be used
