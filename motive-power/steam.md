**Notes:**

 - Having owned a few of these both first and secondhand, I can definitely say I consider them solid models. However, I'm fairly certain (at least some of) the non-streamlined versions should have red cab roofs. Perhaps I'll be one day be confident enough in my airbrush skills to fix this :).
