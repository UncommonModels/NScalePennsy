This post focuses on boxcar models crafted to replicate the boxcars of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Every detail—from the exterior paintwork to the accurate scale dimensions—has been carefully reproduced. We discuss the challenges of modeling such a utilitarian piece of rolling stock and the techniques used to ensure historical precision.

Join us as we examine this essential component of railroad history, both in model form and in reality.
