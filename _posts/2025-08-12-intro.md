Welcome to NScalePennsy!

This site is dedicated to sharing my passion for N scale model railroading, with a special focus on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Here, you'll find project updates, layout ideas, tips, and inspiration for fellow hobbyists. Whether you're just starting out or have years of experience, I hope you'll find something useful and enjoyable.

A quick note: the site is a living document and work in progress. I'll be adding more content as time allows. The blog will primarily document my journey building an N scale layout, sharing stories, challenges, and lessons learned along the way. In addition to the blog, I hope to develop a database of models and resources to help other enthusiasts with their own projects.

Stay tuned for regular posts about building, detailing, and operating N scale layouts. Thanks for visiting!
