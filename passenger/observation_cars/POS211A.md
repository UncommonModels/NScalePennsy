The POS211A-style observation cars were commissioned from Pullman for the Fleet of Modernism.

| Manufacturer | Model Number | Car Name           | Paint Scheme       | Lights  |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Centralia    | CCS7508-02   | Juniata Narrows    | Fleet of Modernism | Battery |
| Centralia    | CCS7508-03   | Lewiston Narrows   | Fleet of Modernism | Battery |
| Centralia    | CCS7509-03   | John Edgar Thomson | Tuscan 3 Stripe    | Battery |


**Notes:**
 - The Centralia Car Shops cars are slightly inaccurate, as some scouring of forums reveal they are following Pullman's plan 4082 instead of the 4081A that sources indicate the PRR used. There are a few extra windows compared to the prototype, and one is missing from the compartment side. The hallway side window pattern is significantly different. Overall, given the lack of options, I'd rate these as acceptable stand-ins.
