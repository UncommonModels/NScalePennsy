  <h2>Welcome to the N Scale Pennsy project</h2>
  <p>This site chronicles my attempt to be prototypically correct to the Pennsylvania Railroad's operations in the
    "Fleet
    of Modernism" era (1938~1948). I attempt to list (mostly) accurate product offerings for each piece of rolling stock
    on the market today. Occasionally I may list "close enough" substitutions for hard to find items. In the long term,
    this will help me facilitate market research for car or locomotive kits that may be released under the <a
      href="https://www.uncommonmodels.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uncommon Models</a> banner. </p>
